This project presents a smart safety mechanism for motorbikes using machine learning and image processing technologies. The system ensures that the motorbike starts only if the rider is wearing a helmet, thereby promoting road safety and compliance with traffic regulations. A camera mounted on the motorbike captures video input, which is analyzed using a trained machine learning model to detect the presence of a helmet. If a helmet is detected, the bike's engine will start; otherwise, it remains inactive. The proposed system combines real-time video processing and trained data analysis to deliver an efficient and user-friendly solution for reducing road accidents and encouraging safe riding practices. This innovation aligns with the vision of integrating smart technologies into daily life to enhance safety and well-being.
